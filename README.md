## Introduction

This lab describes some more advanced concepts related to JavaScript functions.
Be sure to take time to experiment or read up on a concept if you're not
comfortable with the idea before moving on. If you're struggling here, the
remainder of this module will be challenging. Fix any gaps now before moving on.

We also recommend that you complete the lab as you read through the sections.
Reinforcing what you read by physically typing in the code will help make sure
the concepts are locked in. We'll prompt you when it's a good time to shift
modes from "reading along" to coding.

## Define a Function Using Function Declaration

In JavaScript, the most common way to define functions is with a **function
declaration**:

```js
function razzle() {
  console.log("You've been razzled!");
}
```

The word `razzle` becomes a _pointer_ to some stored, potential,
not-yet-actually-run bit of work (the function). We use the _pointer_ to _call_
or _invoke_ the function. We _call_ the function by adding `()` after the
_pointer_.

```js
function razzle() {
  console.log("You've been razzled!");
}
razzle();
//=> "You've been razzled!"
```

Interestingly, you can write function declarations _after_ you call them:

```js
razzle(); //=> "You've been razzled!"
function razzle() {
  console.log("You've been razzled!");
}
```

Functions can be passed arguments, given default arguments, etc. Here's a
brief code synopsis:

```js
function razzle(lawyer = "Billy", target = "'em") {
  console.log(`${lawyer} razzle-dazzles ${target}!`);
}
razzle(); //=> Billy razzle-dazzles 'em!
razzle("Methuselah", "T'challah"); //=> Methuselah razzle-dazzles T'challah!
```

**LAB**: Implement a function called `saturdayFun`. It should return a `String`
like `"This Saturday, I want to ....!"` Fill in the `...` with the activity
that's passed in as the first parameter. If nothing is passed in, default to
`"roller-skate"`. Run `learn` to verify you've gotten the first set of tests
passing before continuing with the lesson.

## Define `Hoisting`

JavaScript's ability to call functions _before_ they appear in the code is
called _hoisting_. For hoisting to work, **the function must be defined using a
function declaration**.

## Define `Function Expression`

We've learned that programming languages feature _expressions_: arrangements of
constants, variables, and symbols that, when interpreted by the language,
produce a _value_. To review, open up your browser console and type in these
examples:

```js
1 + 1; //=> 2
"Razzle " + "dazzle!"; //=> "Razzle dazzle!"
```

The examples above are expressions that return _primitive values_, but
JavaScript also has _function expressions_ that look like this:

```js
function() {
  console.log("Yet more razzling");
}
```

The _value_ returned by this expression is the function itself. Go ahead and
enter the above into the browser console; you should see the following:

```js
Uncaught SyntaxError: Function statements require a function name
```

The problem is that, when the function expression appears by itself as shown
above, **JavaScript does not recognize it as a function expression**; it instead
interprets it as a function declaration that's missing its name. One way to tell
the JavaScript engine that it's a function expression is to use the
`grouping operator ()` to wrap the entire thing:

```js
(function () {
  console.log("Yet more razzling");
});
```

Recall that the grouping operator is usually used in arithmetic operations to
tell the JavaScript engine to evaluate the value that's inside it first. It's
serving a similar purpose in this case: it's telling JavaScript to interpret
what's inside the parentheses as a _value_. With the grouping operator in place,
the JavaScript engine recognizes our function as a function expression. Enter
the function into your console again, this time using the grouping operator. You
should see the following:

```js
ƒ () {
  console.log("Yet more razzling");
}
```

JavaScript now correctly shows us the return value of our function expression: a
_function_ (indicated by the `ƒ ()`) storing the work of logging our message.

## Define `Anonymous Function`

An **anonymous function** is, quite simply, a function that doesn't have a name:

```js
function() {
  console.log("Yet more razzling");
}
```

Unlike a function declaration, there's no function name in front of the `()`.
Note, however, that if we don't assign a name to the function, we have no way to
call it. We lose access to our function immediately after it's created. So how
can we invoke an anonymous function? We've seen one way before: we can use it as
a callback function. For example, you'll often see anonymous functions passed as
an argument to an event listener:

```js
const button = document.getElementById("button");
button.addEventListener("click", function () {
  console.log("Yet more razzling");
});
```

Our anonymous function is being passed as an argument to `addEventListener`. The
JavaScript engine "stores it away" as work to be executed later, when the button
is clicked.

## Define a Function Using a Function Expression

Another way we can solve the problem of accessing an anonymous function is by
declaring a variable and assigning the function as its value. Recall that any
expression can be assigned to a variable; this includes function expressions:

```js
const fn = function () {
  console.log("Yet more razzling");
};
```

The code above defines our function using a function expression. If we ask
JavaScript what's in `fn`, it tells us:

```js
fn; //=> ƒ () { console.log("Yet more razzling") }
```

Here, `fn` is a _pointer_ to the stored block of work that hasn't yet been
invoked. Just as with **function declaration**, to actually do the work, we need
to _invoke_ or _call_ the function. We do this by adding `()` to the end of our
"pointer", the variable name:

```js
const fn = function () {
  console.log("Yet more razzling");
}; //=> undefined
fn; //=> ƒ () { console.log("Yet more razzling") }
fn(); // "Yet more razzling"
```

Also as with a function declaration, if we need to pass arguments to the
function, we would include those in the parentheses when we call the function.

We now know how to define a function as a function expression. Very importantly,
**_function expressions are not hoisted_**. The same is true for any variable
assignment: if we assign a `String` or the result of an arithmetic expression to
a variable, those assignments are not hoisted either.

**LAB**: Implement a function expression called `mondayWork`. The function
should return a `String` like `"This Monday, I will ... ."` Fill in the `...`
with the activity that's passed in as the first parameter. If nothing is passed
in, default to `"go to the office"`. Run `learn` to verify you've gotten this
set of tests passing before continuing with the lesson.

## Define an IIFE: Immediately-Invoked Function Expression

Another way to invoke an anonymous function is by creating what's known as an
`immediately-invoked function expression (IIFE)`.

As a thought experiment, consider what happens here:

```js
(function (baseNumber) {
  return baseNumber + 3;
})(2); //=> ???
```

We recognize the first `()` as the grouping operator that tells the JavaScript
engine to interpret the contents as a value — in this case, a function
expression. What this means is that, in the IIFE statement, the value returned
by the first set of parentheses is an anonymous function, which can be invoked
(immediately).

The second `()` are the `()` of function invocation. When we put them
immediately after the first set of parentheses, we're invoking the function that
those parentheses return immediately after defining it. Try it out in the
browser console:

```js
(function (baseNumber) {
  return baseNumber + 3;
})(2); //=> 5
```

Interestingly, any variables, functions, `Array`s, etc. that are defined
_inside_ of the function expression's body _can't_ be seen _outside_ of the
IIFE. To see this, check the value of `baseNumber` in the console. It's like
opening up a micro-dimension, a bubble-universe, doing all the work you could
ever want to do there, and then closing the space-time rift. We'll see some of
the practical power of "hiding things" in IIFEs a little later in this lesson.

## Define `Function-Level Scope`

JavaScript exhibits "function-level" scope. This means that if a function is
defined _inside another_ function, the inner function has access to all the
parameters of, as well as any variables defined in, the outer function. This
works recursively: if we nest a third function inside the inner function, it
will have access to all the variables of both the inner and outer enclosing
functions. Each of the enclosing parents' scopes are made available via the
_scope chain_. We will define the scope chain a bit later in this lesson. Let's
start by seeing it in action.

> **ASIDE**: This is where people **really** start to get awed by JavaScript.

Consider this code:

```js
function outer(greeting, msg = "It's a fine day to learn") {
  // 2
  const innerFunction = function (name, lang = "Python") {
    // 3
    return `${greeting}, ${name}! ${msg} ${lang}`; // 4
  };
  return innerFunction("student", "JavaScript"); // 5
}

outer("Hello"); // 1
//=> "Hello, student! It's a fine day to learn JavaScript"
```

Let's break this down:

1. We call `outer`, passing `"Hello"` as an argument.
2. The argument (`"Hello"`) is saved in `outer`'s `greeting` parameter. The
   other parameter, `msg`, is set to a default value.
3. Here's our old friend the function expression. It expects two arguments, to
   be stored in the parameters `name` and `lang`, and `lang` is assigned the
   default value of `"Python"`. The function expression itself is saved in the
   local variable `innerFunction`.
4. Inside `innerFunction` we make use of its parameters, `name` and `lang`,
   **_as well as_** the `greeting` and `msg` parameters defined in
   innerFunction's containing (parent) function, `outer`. `innerFunction` has
   access to those variables via the scope chain.
5. Finally, inside `outer`, we invoke `innerFunction`, passing arguments that
   get stored in `innerFunction`'s `name` and `lang` parameters.

This might look a little bit weird, but it generally makes sense to our
intuition about scopes: inner things can see their parent outer things.

Note that currently, the values of the arguments being passed to `innerFunction`
are part of the **definition** of `outer`. In order to change those values we
have to modify the `outer` function. This is not ideal.

With a simple change, something miraculous can happen. Rather than having `outer`
return the result of calling `innerFunction`, let's have it return the function
itself:

```js
function outer(greeting, msg = "It's a fine day to learn") {
  const innerFunction = function (name, lang = "Python") {
    return `${greeting}, ${name}! ${msg} ${lang}`;
  };
  return innerFunction;
}
```

The return value of `outer` is now an **anonymous function**. To invoke it, we
update the function call as follows:

```js
outer("Hello")("student", "JavaScript");
//=> "Hello, student! It's a fine day to learn JavaScript"
```

The function call is processed by the JavaScript engine from left to right.
First, `outer` is called with the argument "Hello." The return value of calling
`outer("Hello")` is itself a function and, therefore, can itself be called. We
do this by chaining on the second set of parentheses. This is basically the same
concept as assigning a function expression to a variable and using the variable
name followed by `()` to invoke the function. You can almost think of
`outer("Hello")` as the "name" of the function that's returned by `outer`. It's
the same as if we did this:

```js
const storedFunction = outer("Hello");
storedFunction("student", "JavaScript");
//=> "Hello, student! It's a fine day to learn JavaScript"
```

Note that we are no longer calling `innerFunction` from inside `outer`.
Amazingly, the code works **_exactly the same_**: it **_still_** has access to
those parent function's variables. It's like a little wormhole in space-time to
the `outer`'s scope!

We can tighten this code up a bit more: instead of assigning the function
expression to `innerFunction` and returning that, let's just return the function
expression.

```js
function outer(greeting, msg = "It's a fine day to learn") {
  return function (name, lang = "Python") {
    return `${greeting}, ${name}! ${msg} ${lang}`;
  };
}

outer("Hello")("student", "JavaScript");
//=> "Hello, student! It's a fine day to learn JavaScript"
```

To review: we first called `outer`, passing in the argument "Hello". `outer`
**returned an anonymous function** inside which the default value of `msg` and
the passed-in value of `greeting` have now been set. It's almost as if `outer`
returned:

```js
function(name, lang="Python") { // The "inner" function
  return `Hello, ${name}! It's a fine day to learn ${lang}`
}
```

We invoked this returned _"inner" function"_ by adding the second set of
parentheses and passing the arguments `"student"` and `"JavaScript"`, which were
stored in `name` and `lang`. This filled in the final two values inside of the
template string and returned:

```js
"Hello, student! It's a fine day to learn JavaScript";
```

## Define `Closure`

In the previous example, we could call the "inner" function, the **anonymous
function**, a "closure." It "encloses" the function-level scope of its parent.
And, like a backpack, it can carry out the knowledge that it saw — _even when
you're out of the parent's scope_.

Recall the IIFE discussion. Since what's inside an IIFE can't be seen, if we
wanted to let just tiny bits of information leak back out, we might want to
pass that information back out, through a closure.

```js
const array = (function (thingToAdd) {
  const base = 3;
  return [
    function () {
      return base + thingToAdd;
    },
    function () {
      return base;
    },
  ];
})(2);
```

Note that the value on the right of the `=` in the first line is a function
expression. That function takes a single argument and returns an array that
contains two functions. The `(2)` after the function expression executes that
function (immediately), and the two inner functions are stored in the `array`
variable.

Go ahead and copy the code above into your browser console and take a look at the
values of the two elements of `array`. You should see the following:

```js
array[0]; //=> ƒ () { return base + thingToAdd; }
array[1]; //=> ƒ () { return base; }
```

However, if you try looking at the value of `base` in the console you'll get a
reference error: the value of `base` is not accessible outside the function it's
defined in. Now go ahead and _call_ the two returned functions; you should see
the following:

```js
array[0](); //=> 5
array[1](); //=> 3
```

The two functions being returned in `array` are **closures**; they have access
to the `base` variable because it's defined in their parent function. When
they're executed, they "let out" the values of the sum and the original base
number, allowing us to see them.

## Define `Scope Chain`

The mechanism behind all the cool stuff we just saw is the _scope chain_ which
allows functions defined inside functions (inside functions) to access all their
parent (and grandparent) scopes' variables. Here's a simple example:

```js
function demoChain(name) {
  const part1 = "hi";
  return function () {
    const part2 = "there";
    return function () {
      console.log(`${part1.toUpperCase()} ${part2} ${name}`);
    };
  };
}

demoChain("Dr. Stephen Strange")()(); //=> HI there Dr. Stephen Strange
```

When it is called, the innermost function has access to `name`, `part1`, and
`part2` through the _scope chain_. As a result, when the `console.log()`
statement is run, the string includes all three values. That's awesome wormhole,
space-time magic!

**LAB**:

Implement a function called `saturdayFun`:

- It should define a function
- It uses a default argument, `'roller-skate'` when no arguments are passed
  - allows the default argument to be overridden

Implement a function called `mondayWork`:

- It should define a function
- It uses a default argument, `'go to the office'` when no arguments are passed
  - allows the default argument to be overridden

Implement a function called `wrapAdjective`:

- It should return a function
  - This "inner" function should:
    - take a single parameter that should default to `"special"`. Name it
      however you wish.
    - return a `String` of the form "You are ..." where `...` should be the
      adjective this function received wrapped in visual flair
- It should take as parameter a `String` that will be used to create visual flair
- You may call the parameter whatever you like, but its default value should
  be `"*"`
- Call example: `const encouragingPromptFunction = wrapAdjective("!!!")`

Thus a total call should be:

```js
wrapAdjective("%")("a dedicated programmer"); //=> "You are %a dedicated programmer%!"
```

Run `learn` to verify you've gotten this set of tests passing.

## Conclusion

In this lesson, we've covered the basics of function declaration, invocation,
and function scope. As a refresher on your skills, we've provided a simple lab
to make sure that you're set for the new information coming up in the rest of
this module.
